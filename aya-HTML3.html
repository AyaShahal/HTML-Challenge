      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Depression (also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.

        To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks.There are different types of depression, some of which develop due to specific circumstances.

        Major depression, which includes symptoms of depression most of the time for at least 2 weeks that typically interfere with oneâ€™s ability to work, sleep, study, and eat.
        Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia), which often includes less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, typically for at least 2 years.</p>

        <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
        <P>Medication: The most common treatment for depression is the use of antidepressants. These drugs work by balancing chemicals in your brain called neurotransmitters that affect mood and emotions. There are several categories of antidepressants. The best way to find out which one could work for you is consulting your psychiatrist or physician and obtaining a prescription. These drugs normally take 2 to 4 weeks before you will notice a change in your mood. Most people with depression find that medication works.</P>
